I developed a Roommate Finder Web Application to address a real problem I observed as a hosteler—students often struggle to find compatible roommates due to differences in lifestyle, habits, and emotional preferences. 
This full-stack project is built using React.js for the frontend, styled with Material-UI for a modern and responsive UI. 
The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database for storing user and post data. 
I implemented JWT-based authentication to ensure secure login and protected routes, and used bcrypt for password encryption to enhance data security.
The project follows a client-server architecture with clear separation of concerns. I used React Context API for efficient state management .
 Axios is used for API communication, to handle request/response lifecycle and errors like network issues or authorization failures. 
Allowing users to upload images, enter post details like title, description, and categories, and then publish their roommate requirements. The form updates dynamically, and users get real-time visual feedback with progress tracking during image uploads.
From a UX standpoint, the app offers a responsive and clean interface using Material-UI's breakpoint system.
 Navigation is managed with React Router, enabling smooth transitions and automatic redirects after successful actions. 
The project includes thoughtful error handling, with meaningful alerts for request failures, session timeouts, and validation errors.
To ensure scalability and performance, 
I implemented lazy loading for components, optimized images, and kept state updates minimal. This project demonstrates real-world problem-solving, secure file handling, and complete end-to-end development. 
It’s fully deployed on Render, making it accessible anytime. Overall, this project highlights my skills in building secure, scalable, and user-friendly web applications, and reflects my interest in this domain.
